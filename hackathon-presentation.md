Students and faculty in campus resource management systems face:
- **Complex Navigation**: Multiple pages to book mentors, track submissions, find resources

- Learns from user patterns to improve over time

## 2. How Different from Existing Solutions?

### Traditional Campus Systems
❌ Menu-driven navigation  
❌ Static forms and workflows  
❌ No personalization  
❌ Reactive (user must search)  

### Smart Concierge
✅ **Natural Conversation**: "Book a mentor for IoT" instead of clicking through menus  
✅ **Context-Aware**: Knows your projects, pending tasks, and suggests next steps  
✅ **Proactive**: "You have 3 pending approvals" without asking  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Same experience on web and voice-enabled kiosks  
✅ **Learning**: Gets smarter with each interaction
